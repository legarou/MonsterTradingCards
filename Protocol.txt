Protocol

----- Technical Steps (designs, failures and selected solutions)
uploaded databank diagram
idea that was tossed: I had a class for Stack that had all the cards in a list and the four cards from the deck in another list. But just reading that out of the database is a much simpler and better approach, so I deleted it.

----- Unit Tests (why these tests were chosen and why the tested code is critical) 
Testing all the battle classes because they have to work properly, and return the correct winners and follow the rulse of the battle correctly.

Battle Class: 
-> checking all the different possibilies of an outcome to make sure it does it right
• isGameOver()
• battlePostprocessing()
• oneRoundFight()
• elementFight()
• cardFight()
• start()

BattleElements:
• checkForTrump() - checks whteher any of the cards has an element type that wins over the other
-> important to have it working correctly because the result of the battle depends on it

BattleSpeicialCases Class: 
-> checking all the different possibilies of an outcome to make sure it does it right
• checkForSpecialCase()
• spellAndMonster()
• twoMonsters()

Token Handler Class:
• verifyToken)( - make sure if verifies the tokens correctly
• getUsername() - check that it returns the username correctly or an empty string if not possible



----- Tracked time
November 6: ~1 hour -> prepare UML diagram
November 7: ~3 hours -> first upload, start of project and start of battle class
Movember 10: ~3 hours -> working on battle class
November 11: ~2 hours -> rewrite some functions in battle class (had many different funcions tat were downsized)

December 28: ~3 hours -> downloaded and added maven, docker and postman

January 1: ~2 hours -> planning out how to continue with project and set up databank
January 4: ~2 hours -> starting on test cases
January 5: ~4 hours -> working on test cases
January 6: ~4-5 hours -> working on databank and database manager
January 7: ~3 hours -> started on server
January 11: ~5 hours -> working on server handling
January 12: ~4 hours -> working on server handling
January 13: ~5 hours -> working on server handling
January 14: ~4 hours -> working on server handling
January 15: ~5 hours -> working on server handling
January 16: ~4 hours -> working on server handling
January 17: ~4 hours -> working on server handling and tests
January 19: ~6 hours -> finish test cases, small fixes, write protocol and re-write lost UML diagram

----- Lessons learned
If the layout is not properly planned, you will have to change up your setup a few times. I redid my battle class a few times.
It is also okay to redo a whole class instead of adapting it to make it much better.

----- Unique feature
I have a function called rollDiceForBoost(String username, List<Card> deck) that gets cfalled during the fight between two cards at the beginning of each round.
It "randomly" chooses a number between 0 and 9 and compares it to the string lenghth of the username of the player modulo 10 (to make it more unique for each user).
It then compare the number to (the string lenghth of the username of the player modulo 10) and if it is the same number, each card in the players deck gets a boost for the whole game of plus 5-10 attack points, again random.
So a "waek" deck could become much stronger with some luck!
